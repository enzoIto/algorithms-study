# Self-study *Introduction to Algorithms* with me.

This repo was created to study the book *Introduction to Algorithms* by *Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest e Clifford Stein.*.

## How this works?

Using the fourth edition of this book, i'm gonna solve some exercises about the chapters that i'm going trough. I'm gonna use python because a believe that is the best lang to solve this kind of exercises, because it make algorithms kinda simple to make. Feel free to message me about any mistakes in the code!
